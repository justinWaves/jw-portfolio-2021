          ...and I am a Frontend-focused software engineer. From consumer-facing websites, to full-stack web applications, I have been creating digital products since 2013. Today, my stack of choice is React, Next.JS, Typescript, Tailwind, and Redux. 
With a
          strong foundation in Data Structures, algorithms, Big O, and expertise
          with Typescript, I will ship well tested, production ready code optimized for
          performance and scalability.
