          beautiful and performant web and mobile applications. In 2013, after
          successfully deploying my first consumer-facing website, I fell in
          love with the world of software development and dove in deep,
          completing courses in CS fundamentals, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, HTML &
          CSS. Two major skills I have developed from being a self-taught
          programmer, is the ability to learn new tech efficiently, and the
          ability communicate the needs of many non-technical clients and
          ultimately ship and deploy final products they are happy with. With a
          strong foundation in Data Structures, algorithms, Big O, expertise
          with Typescript, I will ship well tested, production ready code with
          performance and scalability considerations.
