## Hello friend! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊

This is my 2021 Portfolio Website I designed and built with React. Implemented in Typescript.

### Theme Switching 💅

I handled the light/ dark mode using Styled-Themes / Styled-Components. I only use Styled-components for styles effected by theme switch and included them in the body of each component. The rest of the styling is handled by good-ol CSS files.
The theme switching Logic is tucked away in its own file/ folder called "Theme Manager" which utilizes React's Context API. I was initially going to use Redux for this but I found this method to be much cleaner for this purpose.

### React-Spring 🏄‍♂

I used a really cool js animation library called react-spring to handle certain events. I cant wait to play with this more. You can see this on the git-hub icon button onClick. cool stuff.

### Email.JS 🖥

To handle my email server as of now I used Email.js. Very easy to use and implement. Logic for my validation function and all event handling is found in the footer.tsx component (Controlled Component).
