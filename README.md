## Hello friend! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊

This is my 2021 Porftolio Website I designed and built with React, and implimented in Typescript.

### Theme Switching 💅
I handled the light/ dark mode using Styled-Themes / Styled-Components. I only use Styled-components for styles effected by theme switch and included them in the body of each component. The rest of the styling is handled by good-ol CSS files. 

The theme swicthing Logic is tucked away in its own file/ folder called "Theme Manager" which utilizes React's Context API. I was initally going to use Redux for this but I found this method to be much cleaner. 


### React-Spring 🏄‍♂
I used a really cool js animation libraey called react-spring to handle cetain events. I cant wait to play with this more. You can see this on the git-hub icon button onClick. cool stuff.

### Email.JS 🖥
To handle my email server as of now I used Email.js. Very easy to use and implement. Logic for my validation function and all event handling is found in the footer.tsx component... which is a Controlled Component if you were wondering.
